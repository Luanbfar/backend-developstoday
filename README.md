# Instructions to Run the Server

This project is a backend server developed with Node.js. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the server locally.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can check if they are installed by running the following commands:

  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

  If they are not installed, you can download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Steps to Run the Server

1. **Navigate to the server directory:**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the server folder:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project/server
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path where the project is located.

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the server:**

   After installing the dependencies, you can start the server with the command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the server:**

   The server will start and will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified in your configuration). You can test the server using tools like Postman or by visiting the endpoint in your browser.
